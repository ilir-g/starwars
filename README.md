This is a project console App developed in .net framework 4.7.2 for calculating how many stops for resupply are required to make the distance between the planets, based on a given input that is the distance and should be in mega light(MGLT).
1. Download or clone the project from repository
2. Open visual studio and run the project, make sure that you have installed the targeting .net framework 4.7.2
3. It will be required to enter a number (int) as an input for the distance
4. Then the app takes all the details for the planets and calculates the stops needed to cover the distance.
  For example if the input is equal to 100 you will see in console the output as below:
   Executor: 40
   Sentinel-class landing craft: 70
